        "In this project we will be training supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for image classification using the Chest X-Rays dataset compiled by the Naional Institutes of Health. The set contains 112,120 images in 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution and patient data with class labels of disease type for each observation. The class labels are as follows:\n",

Training and tuning such models is important work that can advance research, lead to early intervention, and guide treatment plans.
